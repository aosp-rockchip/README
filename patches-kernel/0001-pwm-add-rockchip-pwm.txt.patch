+Rockchip PWM controller
+
+Required properties:
+- compatible: should be "rockchip,<name>-pwm"
+- reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers
+- #pwm-cells: should be 2.  The first cell specifies the per-chip index
+  of the PWM to use and the second cell is the period in nanoseconds.
+- pinctrl-names: must contain a "default" entry.
+- pinctrl-0: the pincontrol settings to configurethe.
+- clocks: phandle to the PWM source clock
+- clock-names: list of clock names sorted in the same order as the clocks.
+- status: for device state control (enabled/disabled).
+
+Example:
+
+pwm1: pwm@53fb4000 {
+	#pwm-cells = <2>;
+	compatible = "fsl,imx53-pwm", "fsl,imx27-pwm";
+	reg = <0x53fb4000 0x4000>;
+	interrupts = <61>;
+};
+pwm0: pwm@ff680000 {
+	compatible = "rockchip,rk-pwm";
