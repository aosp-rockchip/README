Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: Provide power-domains for
 sd/sdio/emmc/pcie
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The PM domain will be "powered on" once we have registered our PM domain
with genpd and when the device (dw_mmc etc) gets attached to the domain.
The attach occurs when the platform bus'->probe() function get invoked
for the device.

Genpd monitors each device within the domain. To allow it to "power
off", all devices in same domain needs to be runtime PM enabled and
runtime PM suspended.

Due to this, we should be able to deploy genpd support+an updated
DTB, without first having to deploying runtime PM support in the
related drivers. In other words, we could be able to work on these
things almost independently of each otherã€‚

So let's only provide power-domains to each devices' node to make
power policy collect the unreferenced ones once avaiable.

But please KEEP IN MIND that this patch doesn't mean we don't support
rpm or any genpd control related stuff on the future, which in other
words means that could be available later.
