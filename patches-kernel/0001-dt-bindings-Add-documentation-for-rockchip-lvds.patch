+Rockchip RK3288 LVDS interface
+================================
+
+Required properties:
+- compatible: "rockchip,rk3288-lvds";
+
+- reg: physical base address of the controller and length
+	of memory mapped region.
+- clocks: must include clock specifiers corresponding to entries in the
+	clock-names property.
+- clock-names: must contain "pclk_lvds"
+
+- avdd1v0-supply: regulator phandle for 1.0V analog power
+- avdd1v8-supply: regulator phandle for 1.8V analog power
+- avdd3v3-supply: regulator phandle for 3.3V analog power
+
+- rockchip,grf: phandle to the general register files syscon
+
+- rockchip,data-mapping: should be "vesa" or "jeida",
+	This describes how the color bits are laid out in the
+	serialized LVDS signal.
+- rockchip,data-width : should be <18> or <24>;
+- rockchip,output: should be "rgb", "lvds" or "duallvds",
+	This describes the output face.
+
+Required nodes:
+
+The lvds has two video ports as described by
+	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.
+Their connections are modeled using the OF graph bindings specified in
+	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt.
+
+- video port 0 for the VOP inputs
+- video port 1 for either a panel or subsequent encoder
+
+Example:
+	lvds: lvds@ff96c000 {
+		compatible = "rockchip,rk3288-lvds";
+		rockchip,grf = <&grf>;
+		reg = <0xff96c000 0x4000>;
+		clocks = <&cru PCLK_LVDS_PHY>;
+		clock-names = "pclk_lvds";
+		avdd1v0-supply = <&vdd10_lcd>;
+		avdd1v8-supply = <&vcc18_lcd>;
+		avdd3v3-supply = <&vcca_33>;
+		rockchip,data-mapping = "jeida";
+		rockchip,data-width = <24>;
+		rockchip,output = "rgb";
+		ports {
+			#address-cells = <1>;
+			#size-cells = <0>;
+
+			lvds_in: port@0 {
+				reg = <0>;
+
+				lvds_in_vopb: endpoint@0 {
+					reg = <0>;
+					remote-endpoint = <&vopb_out_lvds>;
+				};
+				lvds_in_vopl: endpoint@1 {
+					reg = <1>;
+					remote-endpoint = <&vopl_out_lvds>;
+				};
+			};
+
+			lvds_out: port@1 {
+				reg = <1>;
+
+				lvds_out_panel: endpoint {
+					remote-endpoint = <&panel_in>;
+				};
+			};
+		};
+	};
