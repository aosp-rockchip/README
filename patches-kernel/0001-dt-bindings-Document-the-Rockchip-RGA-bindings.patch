 device-tree bindings for rockchip 2D raster graphic acceleration controller (RGA)
 
-RGA is a separate 2D raster graphic acceleration unit. It accelerates 2D
+RGA is a standalone 2D raster graphic acceleration unit. It accelerates 2D
 graphics operations, such as point/line drawing, image scaling, rotation,
 BitBLT, alpha blending and image blur/sharpness.
 
 Required properties:
 - compatible: value should be one of the following
-		"rockchip,rk3228-rga";
 		"rockchip,rk3288-rga";
 		"rockchip,rk3399-rga";
 
-- interrupts: RGA interrupt number.
+- interrupts: RGA interrupt specifier.
 
 - clocks: phandle to RGA sclk/hclk/aclk clocks
 
-- clock-names: should be "aclk" "hclk" and "sclk"
+- clock-names: should be "aclk", "hclk" and "sclk"
 
 - resets: Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
   See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
-- reset-names: should be "core" "axi" and "ahb"

 Example:
