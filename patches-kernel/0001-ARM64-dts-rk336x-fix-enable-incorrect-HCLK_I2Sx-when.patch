    ARM: dts: rockchip: swap i2s clock ordering on rk3036

    For sound setups using the simple-card mechanism, the main clock
    (sysclk) is expected to be the first element. For the i2s-driver
    itself it doesn't matter, as it uses named clocks, so we can just
    swap them.
----
If we set HCLK_I2Sx at first, rockchip_i2s_set_sysclk will set the
HCLK_I2S freq (from example is 100MHz) to set the i2s_div, it is
incorrect.
