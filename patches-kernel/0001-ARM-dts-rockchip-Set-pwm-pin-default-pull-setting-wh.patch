Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: rockchip: Set pwm pin default pull setting when
 used for pwm regulator
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

As a second global reset, the GRF is not reset, the iomux and
pull of PWM pin is still keeping, but PWM controller is reset,
PWM pin goes into input mode. However, the pull is still none
changed in kernel, which can cause voltage problems, so should
always keep the PWM pin pull down mode, with 0~50 Î¼A power
increase.
