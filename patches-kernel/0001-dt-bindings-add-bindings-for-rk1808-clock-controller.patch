+* Rockchip RK1808 Clock and Reset Unit
+
+The RK1808 clock controller generates and supplies clock to various
+controllers within the SoC and also implements a reset controller for SoC
+peripherals.
+
+Required Properties:
+
+- compatible: should be "rockchip,rk1808-cru"
+- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
+  region.
+- #clock-cells: should be 1.
+- #reset-cells: should be 1.
+
+Optional Properties:
+
+- rockchip,grf: phandle to the syscon managing the "general register files"
+  If missing pll rates are not changeable, due to the missing pll lock status.
+
+Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes can use this identifier
+to specify the clock which they consume. All available clocks are defined as
+preprocessor macros in the dt-bindings/clock/rk1808-cru.h headers and can be
+used in device tree sources. Similar macros exist for the reset sources in
+these files.
+
+External clocks:
+
+There are several clocks that are generated outside the SoC. It is expected
+that they are defined using standard clock bindings with following
+clock-output-names:
+ - "xin24m" - crystal input - required,
+ - "mclk_i2s0_8ch_in" - external I2S clock - optional,
+ - "gmac_clkin" - external GMAC clock - optional
+
+Example: Clock controller node:
+
+	cru: clock-controller@ff350000 {
+		compatible = "rockchip,rk1808-cru";
+		reg = <0x0 0xff350000 0x0 0x5000>;
+		rockchip,grf = <&grf>;
+
+		#clock-cells = <1>;
+		#reset-cells = <1>;
+	};
+
+Example: UART controller node that consumes the clock generated by the clock
+  controller:
+
+	uart1: serial@ff540000 {
+		compatible = "snps,dw-apb-uart";
+		reg = <0xff540000 0x100>;
+		clocks = <&cru SCLK_UART0>, <&cru PCLK_UART0>;
+	};
